## Purpose
This project was intended to create a fun hangman like game in which the user had to pick letters in order to try to guess the word.  

## My Approach
I chose to use a Christmas theme because who doesn't love Christmas!  I made an array of Christmas themed words that can be randomly selected as the guess word.  I created a  variable to hold number of guesses remaining and set that to 10 and displayed it on the page for the user to see.  I created a variable to hold wins and losses and set each to start at 0 and displayed on the page for the user to see.  I created functions to check if any of the letters in the current word matches the key pressed by the user.  If it does, that letter is displayed in the word.  If it doesn't, the remaining guesses number decreases.  Game continues like this until the remaining guesses reach 0 or the user correctly guesses the word.
